Over the last month, stocks and cryptocurrency have put an interest in creating an auto trading bot I hope will further my experience in machine learning models and different API frameworks.

This project will be built on python using pytorch and community sourced yahoo! finance api to gather stock data. This will be a daunting task as I have little experience in day trading stocks and cryptocurrencies as well as the difficulty in coming up with a great model to trade stock successfully.
