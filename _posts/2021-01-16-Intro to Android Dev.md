As I look for jobs and begin really searching for what I would like to accomplish in my software dev career, I have taken upon myself the challenge to expose myself to many different frameworks and languages I have yet to develop in. 

At this point, my ideas are ever changing and growing every day.

From my guesstimation of difficulty I would like to develop a slew of different utilities in Kotlin for android.
From least to most difficult, these are the applications I would like to develop:
    *Car Maintenance Reminder Application/BillsToPay Reminder App
    *Workout Application utilizing different hypertrophy and strength training templates.
    *MovieMatch-tinder but for you and your SO to help choose movies yall would like to watch.

This should be a fun learning experience with many different aspects of android development to learn from.
