    <h1>Stonks</h1>
<p>16 Jan 2021 - Abel Pena</p>

<p>Over the last month, stocks and cryptocurrency have put an interest in creating an auto trading bot I hope will further my experience in machine learning models and different API frameworks.</p>

<p>This project will be built on python using pytorch and community sourced yahoo! finance api to gather stock data. This will be a daunting task as I have little experience in day trading stocks and cryptocurrencies as well as the difficulty in coming up with a great model to trade stock successfully.</p>
