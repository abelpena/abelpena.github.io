    <h1>Web dev</h1>
<p>16 Jan 2021 - Abel Pena</p>

<p>At the beginning of this week, in my pursuit of finding a company name worthy of my exponentially growing endeavors, I started looking for domain names to start building my brand.</p>

<p>I tried looking for a clever name that was uniquely personal and could not come up with an easy to remember domain. To my surprise, my full name(dot)com was available and I could not pass up the opportunity to have a clean domain name.</p>

<p>Thus, began my foray into web development at the very least. I have started building my website on the Jekyll platform that I hope will serve as a good starting point into static website development, to webapps and to start documenting the learning process as I learn many different frameworks I was not exposed to in my university studies.</p>
