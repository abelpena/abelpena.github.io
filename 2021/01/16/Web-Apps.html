    <h1> web apps</h1>
<p>16 Jan 2021 - Abel Pena</p>

<p>I owe this webapp idea to my dad who brought up an idea for a simple construction calculator to figure out different specs for simple construction calculations. The challenges will come with my lack of experience in webapp frameworks like react and xamarin. 
I have choosen to go ahead and start learning flutter for its native ui elements and cross platform ability since the mobile device of preference I use is android and my fathers iOS device.</p>
