    <h1>Intro to android dev</h1>
<p>16 Jan 2021 - Abel Pena</p>

<p>As I look for jobs and begin really searching for what I would like to accomplish in my software dev career, I have taken upon myself the challenge to expose myself to many different frameworks and languages I have yet to develop in.</p>

<p>At this point, my ideas are ever changing and growing every day.</p>

<p>From my guesstimation of difficulty I would like to develop a slew of different utilities in Kotlin for android.
From least to most difficult, these are the applications I would like to develop:
    *Car Maintenance Reminder Application/BillsToPay Reminder App
    *Workout Application utilizing different hypertrophy and strength training templates.
    *MovieMatch-tinder but for you and your SO to help choose movies yall would like to watch.</p>

<p>This should be a fun learning experience with many different aspects of android development to learn from.</p>

<p>-Abel</p>
